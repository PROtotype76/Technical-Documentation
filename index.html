            Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming
            language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991,
            Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its
            notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and
            object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear,
            logical code for small and large-scale projects.

            The binaries for AMD64 will also work on processors that implement the Intel 64 architecture.
            (Also known as the "x64" architecture, and formerly known as both "EM64T" and "x86-64".)
          </p><br />
            <p>There are now "web-based" installers for Windows platforms; 
              the installer will download the needed software components at installation time.</p><br />
            <p>There are redistributable zip files containing the Windows builds,
               making it easy to redistribute Python as part of another software package. Please see the documentation regarding Embedded Distribution for more information.</p>
